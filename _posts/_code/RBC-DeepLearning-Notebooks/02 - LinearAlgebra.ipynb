    "## Linear regression: solving for $A$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider what happens if we have many vectors $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\\mathbf{b}_i$, all of which we want to satisfy the equation $A \\mathbf{x}_i = \\mathbf{b}_i$. If we stack the vectors $\\mathbf{x}_i$ beside each other as the columns of a large matrix $X$ and do the same for $\\mathbf{b}_i$ to form $B$, we can write the problem as a large matrix equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AX = B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things we could do here. If, as before, $A$ is known, we could find $X$ given $B$. To do this, we would just need to apply the techniques described above to solve the system $A \\mathbf{x}_i = \\mathbf{b}_i$ independently for each column $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we were given *both* $X$ and $B$ we could try to find a *single* $A$ which satisfies the equations. In essense, we are fitting a linear function given its inputs $X$ and corresponding outputs $B$. This problem is called *linear regression*. Usually we add a row of ones to $X$ to fit an affine function (i.e. one with an offset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there are only very few cases in which there exists an $A$ which exactly satisfies the equations (if there is, $X$ will be square and invertible). However, we can set things up the same way as before and ask for the *least-squares* $A$ which minimizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\sum_i ||A \\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{b}_i||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using matrix calculus, we can derive the optimal solution to this problem. The answer, one of the most famous formulas in all of mathematics, is known as the *discrete Wiener filter*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A^* = BX^T\\left(XX^T\\right)^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we might have invertibility problems in $XX^T$, this corresponds to having fewer equations than unknowns in our linear system (or duplicated equations), thus leaving some of the elements in $A$ unconstrained. We can get around this in the same way as with linear least squares by adding a small amount of penalty on the norm of the elements of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\sum_i ||A \\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{b}_i||^2 + \\epsilon ||A||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which means we are asking for the matrix of minimum norm which still minimizes the sum squared error on the outputs. Under this cost, the optimal solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A^* = BX^T\\left(XX^T + \\epsilon I\\right)^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is known as *ridge regression*. Often it is a good idea to use a small nonzero value of $\\epsilon$ even if $XX^T$ is technically invertible, because this gives more stable solutions by penalizing large elements of $A$ that aren't doing much to reduce the error. In neural networks, this is known as *weight decay*, and in general, is known as *regularization*. You can also interpret it as having a Gaussian prior with mean zero and variance $1/2\\epsilon$ on each element of $A$.\n",

    "In Python, you should not actually invert the matrix, just type ``np.linalg.lstsq(X, b)``."
