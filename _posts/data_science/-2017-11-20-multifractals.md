## wavelet leaders
Wavelet leaders are derived from the critically sampled discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients. Wavelet leaders offer significant theoretical advantages over wavelet coefficients in the multifractal formalism. Wavelet leaders are time- or space-localized suprema of the absolute value of the discrete wavelet coefficients. The time localization of the suprema requires that the wavelet coefficients are obtained using a compactly supported wavelet. The Holder exponents, which quantify the local regularity, are determined from these suprema. The singularity spectrum indicates the size of the set of Holder exponents in the data.

1-D wavelet leaders are defined as:
