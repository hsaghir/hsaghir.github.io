- The goal: To convey one useful and reusable idea.

- It starts with an introduction that tells a story (explains a situation, introduces a complication) that leads to raising a question. The answer to this question is the main idea of a document which sits at the top of the logical pyramid. The rest of document follows a logical pyramid of thoughts from top to bottom in a dialogue between questions raised in reader's mind and answers written in document. Each point raises a series of questions in reader's mind that the document groups and answers in the following level in the hierarchy. This process continues untill there is no more questions left! 

- Therefore, thinking and writing go hand in hand. We start from an idea, ask WH-questions like "so what?", "why?", "how?", "where is this useful?", "when is this useful?", "who need to pay attention?", and group the answers as we go down the pyramid. We have to decide whether to answer each question deductively (birds fly, I am a bird, therefore I fly) or inductively (*Birds* fly for 3 reasons. 1- birds have wings 2- birds are lightweight 3- birds are aerodynamic). This will determine the structure of the thought process. After having the structure set, we then expand on each point with a paragraph clearly stating the point, providing evidence, and examples.
