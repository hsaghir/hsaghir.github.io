# Buffet's 1992 Shareholders' letter
```text
 "We select our marketable equity securities in much the way we would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety.  We want  the business to be one (a) that we can understand; (b) with 
favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; and (d) available at a very attractive price."

But how, you will ask, does one decide what's "attractive"? In answering this question, most analysts feel they must choose  between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition:  "value" and "growth." In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip:  Growth is always a component 
in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose  importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.

In addition, we think the very term "value investing" is redundant.  What is "investing" if it is not the act of seeking value at least sufficient to justify the amount paid?  Consciously paying more for a stock than its calculated value - in the hope that it can soon be sold for a still-higher price - should be labeled speculation (which is neither illegal, immoral nor - in our view - financially fattening).

Typically, "value" connotes the purchase of stocks having attributes such as a low ratio of price to book value, a low price-earnings ratio, or a high dividend yield.  Unfortunately, such characteristics, even if they appear in combination, are far from determinative as to whether an investor is indeed buying something for what it is worth and is therefore truly operating on the principle of obtaining value in his investments.  Correspondingly, opposite characteristics - a high ratio of price to book value, a high price-earnings ratio, and a low dividend yield - are in no way inconsistent with a "value" purchase.

Similarly, business growth, per se, tells us little about value.  It's true that growth often has a positive impact on value, sometimes one of spectacular proportions.  But such an effect is far from certain.  For example, investors have regularly poured money into the domestic airline business to finance profitless (or worse) growth.  For these investors, it would have been far better if Orville had failed to get off the ground at Kitty Hawk: The more the industry has grown, the worse the disaster for owners.

Growth benefits investors only when the business in point can invest at incremental returns that are enticing - in other words, only when each dollar used to finance the growth creates over a dollar of long-term market value.  In the case of a low-return business requiring incremental funds, growth hurts the investor.

In The Theory of Investment Value, written over 50 years ago, John Burr Williams set forth the equation for value, which we condense here:  The value of any stock, bond or business today is determined by the cash inflows and outflows - discounted at an appropriate interest rate - that can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the asset.  Note that the formula is the same for stocks as for bonds.  Even so, there is an important, and difficult to deal with, difference between the two:  A bond has a coupon and maturity date that define future cash flows; but in the case of equities, the investment analyst must himself estimate the future "coupons."  Furthermore, the quality of management affects the bond coupon only rarely - chiefly when management is so inept or dishonest that payment of interest is suspended.  In contrast, the ability of management can dramatically affect the equity "coupons."

The investment shown by the discounted-flows-of-cash calculation to be the cheapest is the one that the investor should purchase - irrespective of whether the business grows or doesn't, displays volatility or smoothness in its earnings, or carries a high price or low in relation to its current earnings and book value.  Moreover, though the value equation has usually shown equities to be cheaper than bonds, that result is not inevitable: When bonds are calculated to be the more attractive investment, they should be bought.

Leaving the question of price aside, the best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return.  The worst business to own is one that must, or will, do the opposite - that is, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low rates of return.  Unfortunately, the first type of business is very hard to find:  Most high-return businesses need relatively little capital.  Shareholders of such a business usually will benefit if it pays out most of its earnings in dividends or makes significant stock repurchases.

Though the mathematical calculations required to evaluate equities are not difficult, an analyst - even one who is experienced and intelligent - can easily go wrong in estimating future "coupons."  At Berkshire, we attempt to deal with this problem in two ways.  

	+ First, we try to stick to businesses we believe we understand.  That means they must be relatively simple and stable in character.  If a business is complex or subject to constant change, we're not smart enough to predict future cash flows.  Incidentally, that shortcoming doesn't bother us.  What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know.  An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she avoids big mistakes.

	+ Second, and equally important, we insist on a margin of safety in our purchase price.  If we calculate the value of a common stock to be only slightly higher than its price, we're not interested in buying.  We believe this margin-of-safety principle, so strongly emphasized by Ben Graham, to be the cornerstone of investment success.

# core principles and investment policies (Ben Graham - Warren Buffet)

```text
The most realistic distinction between the investor and the spec- ulator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements. The speculator’s primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor’s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell.

It is far from certain that the typical investor should regularly hold off buying until low market levels appear, because this may involve a long wait, very likely the loss of income, and the possible missing of investment opportunities. On the whole it may be better for the investor to do his stock buying whenever he has money to put in stocks, except when the general market level is much higher than can be justified by well-established standards of value. If he wants to be shrewd he can look for the ever-present bargain oppor- tunities in individual securities.

Aside from forecasting the movements of the general market, much effort and ability are directed on Wall Street toward selecting stocks or industrial groups that in matter of price will “do better” than the rest over a fairly short period in the future. Logical as this endeavor may seem, we do not believe it is suited to the needs or temperament of the true investor—particularly since he would be competing with a large number of stock-market traders and first- class financial analysts who are trying to do the same thing. As in all other activities that emphasize price movements first and underlying values second, the work of many intelligent minds con- stantly engaged in this field tends to be self-neutralizing and self- defeating over the years.

The investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their prices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned by sizable declines nor become excited by sizable advances. He should always remember that market quotations are there for his convenience, either to be taken advantage of or to be ignored. He should never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell one because it has gone down. He would not be far wrong if this motto read more simply: “Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or sell one immediately after a substantial drop.”



 But note this important fact: The true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.* Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly wor- ried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons’ mistakes of judgment.

Let us close this section with something in the nature of a para- ble. Imagine that in some private business you own a small share that cost you $1,000. One of your partners, named Mr. Market, is very obliging indeed. Every day he tells you what he thinks your interest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or to sell you an additional interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of value appears plausible and justified by business developments and prospects as you know them. Often, on the other hand, Mr. Market lets his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him, and the value he proposes seems to you a little short of silly.
If you are a prudent investor or a sensible businessman, will you let Mr. Market’s daily communication determine your view of the value of a $1,000 interest in the enterprise? Only in case you agree with him, or in case you want to trade with him. You may be happy to sell out to him when he quotes you a ridiculously high price, and equally happy to buy from him when his price is low. But the rest of the time you will be wiser to form your own ideas of the value of your holdings, based on full reports from the company about its operations and financial position.
```


Three core lessons from Ben Graham:
1. attitude toward the market (chapter 8)
	- the market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who buys from the pessimists and sells to the optimists. 
		+ two ways this can happen is by timing and pricing. If you focus on timing and forcasting the market, you'll end up being an speculator and lose money. But you can make money by focusing on pricing. Buying a company at a price that is a margin of safety lower than the value and selling at value or above is the act of investing. The question is then how do you determine the value of a company considering its business, market, competition, growth, and management?


	- The whole structure of stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction. This really means that, in a very real sense, the better the quality of a common stock (and the more it is widely believed), the more speculative it is likely to be—at least as compared with the unspectacular middle-grade issues.


	- A serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or even month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him richer or poorer. In any case the investor may as well resign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more from their high point at various periods in the next five years.

	- The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If your become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street 'fact' on faith, and you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady advantage of even the worst bear market. By developing your discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people's mood swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave. 
		+ Your shares have advanced, good! You are richer than you were, good! But has the price risen too high, and should you think of selling? Or should you kick yourself for not having bought more shares when the level was lower? Or— worst thought of all—should you now give way to the bull-market atmosphere, become infected with the enthusiasm, the overconfi- dence and the greed of the great public (of which, after all, you are a part), and make larger and dangerous commitments? Presented thus in print, the answer to the last question is a self-evident no, but even the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will power to keep from following the crowd.

	- The longer a bull market lasts, the more severely investors will be afflicted with amnesia; after five years or so, many people no longer believe that bear markets are even possible. All those who forget are doomed to be reminded; and, in the stock market, recovered memories are always unpleasant.



2. the notion of margin of safety
	- the future value of every investment is a function of its present price. The higher the price that you pay, the lower your return will be. 

	- No matter how careful you are, the one risk that no investor can ever eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what Graham called the 'margin of safety' - never overpaying no matter how exciting an investment seems to be - can you minimize the odds of the error. 

3. looking at stocks as businesses:
	- a stock  is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that does not depend on the share price.



# circle of competence

1. Can you break down different moving parts of the economics of business and how important each is? Can you understand the economic characteristics of this business? Can you draw a business model canvas for the business? Can you predict how the economics will look like in 5-10 years?

2. put yourself in customer's shoes. why buy from this company and not another? why this product and not alternatives? what do customers value most in each segment of the business?

3. why is this company going to win? can an idiot with 1B$ destroy their business? why buy this company and not its competitor?

4. what is the growth engine (hedgehog principle) of this business ? are they executing on it? For example, Warren understood early on the relationship between a uniquely positioned brand, and pouring money into TV advertisement for accelerating the growth of the brand. Back then, If you bought the top brand in a market, you made the top money, and you could pour more money into TV ads than competitors and even grow faster. This positive feedback loop for growing brands was the hedgehog principle of brands that Warren understood and bought as many businesses with this dynamic as he could.


# other Buffet principles:

- Always look for a business with a clear-cut competitive advantage. If you can’t explain to your spouse what makes a company special as a long-term moneymaker, it probably isn’t.

- Try to find companies with a small market share, a huge addressable market, and a large competitive advantage. This was Warren Buffett’s recipe for success with Geico, a once-tiny auto insurer that sold directly to consumers rather than pay agents’ commissions. 

- never confuse a growing industry with a profitable one. 

- Avoid businesses whose best days are behind them. This is true even if you’re paying a cheap price relative to current earnings or book value because, in the long run, underlying business quality trumps price. Exhibit A: Sears Holdings looked cheap all the way down until it declared bankruptcy. 

- With the help of his partner Charlie Munger, Buffett studied and came to deeply understand the ecosystem of brands and media that empowered them—for that’s what it was, an ecosystem, even though there was no such term at the time. Over the next several decades, he and Munger engaged in a series of lucrative investments in branded companies and the television networks and advertising agencies that enabled them. While ­Graham’s cigar-butt investing remained a staple of his trade, Buffett understood that the big money lay elsewhere. As he wrote in 1967, “Although I consider myself to be primarily in the quantitative school, the really sensational ideas I have had over the years have been heavily weighted toward the qualitative side, where I have had a ‘high-probability insight.’ (Value 2.0: finding a superior business and paying a reasonable price for it.)
	+ The margin of safety lies not in the tangible assets but rather in the sustainability of the business itself. Key to this was the “high-probability insight”—that the company was so dominant, its future so stable, that the multiple one paid in terms of current earnings would not only hold but perhaps also expand. Revolutionary though the insight was at the time, to Buffett this was just math: The more assured the profits in the future, the higher the price you could pay today.

- 


Buffett is known for his unrivaled ability to pick "wonderful companies at a fair price." Wonderful has a qualitative and a quantitative aspect. He quantifies these by studying the financials of the companies. 

It is important to look at the historical trends of following metric for a company and compare it with industry averages to be able to assess a company well. Just looking at one year's numbers may be misleading. 

## uncertainty

- debt to equity ratio determines how risky the business is since too much debt makes a company slugish in adapting to changes in the market. Buffet likes companies with D/E ratio of less than 0.5, that said, different industries might have different norms. 

'D/E ratio = total debt / total equity'

- current ratio determines the company's ability to pay off short term (12 months) debt and therefore, affects flexibility and agility of a business. A lower than 1 current ratio means the company needs to borrow more to pay off debt, while a large current ratio may mean the company has problems in making vendors pay therefore, too much of cash is tied in current assets instead. Buffet likes companies with current ratio of between 1.5-2.5. 

'Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities'

- Management incentives: 
	+ management compensation with false metrics like share price incentivizes them to act in a way that maximizes short term share price for their benefit e.g. not pay out dividend.
 

## Business performance

return on capital or equity assesses the performance of a business in terms of how much return can the business generate given the provided investment. It is important since most of the profits of the company are invested back into the business, therefore, if it is too low, future growth prospects of the company will be affected. 


Greenblatt translated 'wonderful' to Return on Capital (or ROC) in his book 'The Little Book That Beats The Market'. The higher the ROC, the more wonderful the company. ROC combines financing structure and performance by comparing all the money invested in the business with the profits while ROE compares only the equity in the business with profits. Buffet likes companies with consistent or growing ROE of above 8% over the past ten years.

'ROC =  EBIT / tangible capital (cash + assets(equity + debt) )'
'ROE =  EBIT / equity'

ROE and D/E ratio decouple the risk and return factors of a business, and Ben Graham argues that one has to first manage the risks of businesses (D/E ratio) and then consider the remaining choices based on return (ROE).


## Buffet's rules of thumb for price worth paying for a company

Note that these are thresholds and not real numbers worth paying

- set a safe discount rate in calculating intrinsic value at least double or triple federal 10-year bonds.
- intrinsic value: give yourself more than 30% margin of safety from calculated intrinsic value.
- price to earnings (P/E) ratio: companies with smaller P/E ratio than 15 (or minimum return of 6.67%). Forward P/E is analysts guess as to future P/E ratios based on current price. Usually the most conservative estimate is prefered.
- price to book (P/B) ratio determines risk to principle in case of company going out of business. Buffet likes companies with P/B smaller than 1.5, have to also ask "what is behind the book value? is it current market value of tangible assets?"

## Price

As for fair price, Greenblatt translated fair price to earnings yield (acquirer's multiple). the higher the earning yield, the better the price:


'earnings yield = EBIT / enterprise value'


Tobias Carlisle and Wes Gray, Ph.D. these metrics in their book, Quantitative Value. Testing it back to 1964 (until 2004), they found that, a portfolio of companies with highest value of both these metrics among the top 3400 companies, outpaced the market at a 13.9% return rate (compared to 10.5% for the S&P 500). When tested out separately, the earnings yield of the selected stocks returned 16%, while the ROC actually underperformed compared to the S&P. After more research, they concluded that simply using the earnings yield proved to be the most efficient way to find undervalued stocks. 


Quantitative Value is a model-based investment strategy that uses above metrics to generate a portfolio that is strictly followed and re-balanced frequently (quarterly or annually). 


## Intrinsic value of a business - Buffet's way

- The value of a business today is equal to the net profits that it generates in future plus the value of its assets (book value). However, if we pay that price today, we are not going to get any returns. Warren Buffet likes to discount that price by the risk-free interest rate of 10-year bonds, to get to the intrinsic value of a business. 
	+ You'd want to buy at a very good discount compared to the intrinsic value price or see a very promising growth trajectory that is better than a linear growth assumed in the intrinsic value to justify investing in a company. 
		* Alternatively, we can discount that future value by a minimum growth rate we'd like, back to today, to arrive at a price that makes sense for us to buy in. 
	+ share buy-backs and stock-splits distort the book value of a company. In that case look at the future free cash flow of the company in total and not per share.


- The most important rule of investing is protecting the principle and not losing money. That's why having a huge margin of safety in case of worst case scenario is important. This is possible by understanding that risk and uncertainty are two different things that are usually both priced into the business. Interesting businesses are the ones that have minimal risk but have a high degree of uncertainty, therefore, are available at very attractive prices.
	+ Risk is how much of your principle you will lose in the worst case scenario. You should not lose principle!
	+ Uncertainty is not knowing how much upside of growth you get. 

- Warren Buffet actually has a few pillars that he looks into when deciding whether to invest in a business. He likes to think of a company as a castle with management as the knight in charge of it. 
	1. the first one is vigillant leadership. This has qualitative AND quantitative aspects.
		* quantitatively, it's about the ratio of money owed to assets and money coming in compared to money going out.
			+ Debt/Equity ratio: the ratio of company debt to company assets. He likes companies with Debt/Equity ratio below .50. Meaning, if a company makes $10, it only has to pay $5 in debt.
			+ The Current Ratio: the ratio of money coming in in the next 12 months comparted to the money going out. He likes companies that are above 1.50. Meaning every $10 going out on cash, $15 should be cash inflow. 
		* qualitatively, it's about whether the management of the company is careful and somewhat paranoid about potential threat to the company. 
	2. Understandability and stability: He only invests in companies where he understands the business with somewhat consistent and stable record to make prediction of future performance of the business easier. He'd like to be able to understand the weaknesses and strengths of the castle and be able to predict the future performance of the castle.
	3. Long term prospects: He'd like to evaluate if the business model is something that will work in future. He likes castles that will endure future. 
	4. Competative advantage (moat): He likes to see companies that have a sort of competetive advantage that keeps others away like the moat around the castle. 
	5. Undervalued stock: Warren's first rule of investing is protect your principle. He likes to invest in companies that he can buy at a price that gives him a huge margin of safety in case of error in evaluating the company or other unpredictable future adversities. That way, worst case scenario, he should be able to get his principle money back by liqidation of the assets of the company.





- Warren buffet likes to compare investing in companies to government issued bonds, since bonds returns are risk-free given that government can always print new money. Therefore, he discounts the future value of a company 10 years in future by the interest rate of a 10-year bond. That would be the price which if he buys into the company at, he'd get return equal to 10-year bonds. Therefore, to get a return that justifies the risk of investing in a company compared to bonds, he would need to get a much better price. 

- Mohnish Pabrai that learned from Warren to a successful investment career says that he'd only look at companies where the market price is at least two times less than the intrinsic value to give himself a huge margin of safety. 



We need to estimate several things to calculate the intrinsic value of a business and the price at which it makes sense for us to buy in. 
	+ Future value: use the average growth rate in the past to linearly estimate it for example in 10 years in future. Be careful about high growth rate in an extended amount of time in future. very few companies grow at 10% for a sustained amount of time (e.g. 10 yrs). That's why you need to assess the market conditions, maturity of the industry, competitors and etc while determining the growth rate.  
		* not all of the future free cash flow will be reflected in the value of the business since there may be efficiency issues in the company. 
		* Therefore, we can instead use the average book value growth rate and estimate future book value plus the sum of dividends that the company pay during this time. This is the future value of the business 
		* we need to check how good/conservative this estimate is by seeing if 
			- the average growth rate makes sense
			- if linear estimation is conservative enough
	+ Intrinsic value: discount the future value to today by the 10-year bond interest rate. If we use the 10-year bonds interest rate to discount the future value company to today, the price that we get for today will be the price that if we buy the company at, our money will grow similar to a 10-year bonds. Therefore, since government bonds are almost risk-free, and the business may have risk, at that price, buying into the business doesn't make sense.
 


 - The formula that is used to calculate the value of a bond in future or the intrensic value of a stock is:

 $$ price = C * \frac{[1- [\frac{1}{(1+i)^n}]]}{i} + \frac{M}{(1+i)^n} $$

where: 

M = Future value of company (or bond value at maturity)
C = yearly dividend payment over n years (or bond coupon payment)
i = the interest rate in %
n = the number of years in future


## portfolio strategy:

### Buffet
He thinks a focused (not less than 10 and not more than 20) but well-researched and well-priced porfolio minimizes your risk. 

### Ray Dalio 
He thinks a well-diversified and de-correlated portfolio reduced your risk. 
A lot of people think that the best thing to do in investing is to find the one thing with the best return. However, no one really can tell the future and know for certain if one thing is THE best thing. 

Ray argues that the best investment strategy is to maximize the [return/risk] ratio. https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/4-factors-ray-dalio-uses-construct-his-allweather-portfolio/



------
Principles for stock market
------
There are a few important principles that Ray has found that lead to maximization of the return/risk ratio:
1 -  Diversification of assets (Need many diversified return streams)
2 - Correlation of assets with each other (minimizing the correlations of assets)
3 - Sample size of number of assets (big enough to make the law of large numbers rule.) 

-----
Portfolio construction
-----
As a result of this analysis, he practically found that the best investment strategy in a portfolio that maximizes the [return/risk] ratio was to really find 15 to 20 de-correlated return streams (decorrelated assets) each having a decent chance of making money (low risk)!

Since there is uncertainty in asset risk and correlation assessment, an active investor needs to manage this portfolio daily to make sure the law of large numbers works in his favor.

-----
(All weather portfolio)
-----
Based on the return/risk ratio discussed above and balancing the risk in four possible quadrants of economic cycles explained below, Dalio constructed a portfolio for the average person that only requires once a year rebalancing called all weather portfolio. 

“All Weather grew out of Bridgewater’s effort to make sense of the world, to hold the portfolio today that will do reasonably well 20 years from now even if no one can predict what form of growth and inflation will prevail. When investing over the long run, all you can have confidence in is that (1) holding assets should provide a return above cash, and (2) asset volatility will be largely driven by how economic conditions unfold relative to current expectations (as well as how these expectations change). That’s it. Anything else (asset class returns, correlations, or even precise volatilities) is an attempt to predict the future. In essence, All Weather can be sketched out on a napkin. It is as simple as holding four different portfolios each with the same risk, each of which does well in a particular environment: when (1) inflation rises, (2) inflation falls, (3) growth rises, and (4) growth falls relative to expectations.”

It consists of:
-40% long-term bonds, 
- 15% intermediate-term bonds,
- 30% stocks,  
- 7.5% gold, 
- 7.5% commodities.

NASDAQ site suggests buying the following ETFs for implementing the all weather portfolio:
30% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
40% iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT)
15% iShares 7 – 10 Year Treasury ETF (IEF)
7.5% SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD)
7.5% PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC)


http://www.theasymmetricblog.com/new-blog/ suggests following ETFs: 
40%                       VGLT
15%                       VGSH
30%                       VOO
7.5%                      GSG
7.5%                      VGPMX
to implement the strategy at total expense ratio of 1.31%



-----
4 stages of Economic cycles
-----
Dalio says that we can then expect four different seasons that the economy can go through. They are:

Higher than expected inflation (rising prices).
Lower than expected inflation (or deflation).
Higher than expected economic growth.
Lower than expected economic growth.


-----
Warren Buffet
-----
with volatility comes a great opportunity called "Dollar Cost Averaging." 
Dollar Cost Averaging basically just means that you buy the same asset at different prices over a long period of time, so that your average cost basis lowers and you end up generating better returns. 

THE STRATEGY: INVEST $100 EVERY WEEK INTO THE S&P 500 THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER'S 401(K) PLAN (OR $200 BI-WEEKLY)
