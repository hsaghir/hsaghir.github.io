- "Both a math article and a novel are telling a story", "Try to see what the story is b4 you delve into the details"

- "follow the idea back to its origin, and rediscover it for yourself" or to quote Richard Feynman "What I cannot create, I don't understand"

- "Math resembles a game in which the rules had been partially concealed"."Imagine trying to play chess before you know how all of the pieces move!". "Only after these rules have entered your subconscious can your mind turn its full attention to the more creative issues of strategy, tactics, and the like."

-"a mathematical proof is a convincing argument that is expressed in the language of mathematics". Basically, it follows the rules of logic, however, the level of detail in a proof might depend on the audience. Deciphering condensed mathematical proofs needs the knowledge of the math language, logic, and common proof techniques! 

- A proof always contains a hypothesis, if A, and a conclusion, then B. "The first stef in zny proof requires recognizing the statements A and B".
