- Math is a system of conclusions drawn from definitions and assumptions using rules of logic and a set of axioms (obviously True / background assumptions) that must be consistent. Math is often guided by real needs and phenomenons in the real world but imagined postulational systems also exist.

- Axioms are 'background' assumptions we make i.e. "rules of the game", while postulates are the foreground assumptions based on which we develop the rest of the content. A theorem (proposition) is a logical consequence of the postulates using axioms. A Corollary is a theorem that is usually considered an "easy consequence" of another theorem. A "Lemma" is a theorem that is auxiliary to proving some more important theorem.

- There are two main tools available for making conclusions from postulates: 1. intuitive deductions 2. mathematical formalism and rigor (a set of tools and operations).

- For example, consider the case of using variational calculus for finding a density function by maximizing the ELBO using a mean-field (factorized graph) assumption. We make no assumptions about the components of the factorized graph but they turn out to be of the exponential family. Arriving at this conclusion using the intuitive deduction approach is very hard but applying mathematical rigor can simply show this to be the case.

# logical reasoning
1. Induction: going from a series of observations to a statement of a general law governing all occurances, it's certainty depends on the number of observations. Mathematical induction is usually used for showing the truth of a theorem for an infinite sequence, for example we prove the theorem for case n=1, n=2, and n=k and therefore conclude for the infinite case. This depends on proving that if any statement about k is true, the next statement k+1 is also true.

2. Deduction:
