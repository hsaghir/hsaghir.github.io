### Short Bio

I received my Master of Science degree in mechatronics from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2011. I worked on brain-inspired intelligent controllers that learned control policies through reinforcement learning based on emotional processing in brain. Prior to joining the University of Toronto, I spent some time at the Italian institute of Technology working on motion planning and control of legged locomotion for the [HyQ](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/hyq-quadruped-robot-is-back-with-even-more-tricks) quadruped robot. I currently hold the **[Ontario Trillium Scholarship](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/International-Student-Awards.aspx)** for PhD study at [IBBME](http://www.ibbme.utoronto.ca/). My research interests include non-linear and fractal dynamics, deep learning, reinforcement learning and robotics. 

### Research

**Complex dynamics of neuro-physiological signals**

Cardiac function is regulated by a network of control mechanisms comprising of the central autonomic network, sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), central and peripheral oscillators, humoral factors, and the sinus node (Malliani, Pagani, Lombardi, & Cerutti, 1991; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology, 1996). The interplay of these control mechanisms constitute a complex system (Kantelhardt, 2008) with non-linearly interacting components (Billman, 2013), whose global behavior cannot be explained as the sum of its parts (Kantelhardt, 2008). This notion is often ignored in traditional analyses (e.g. averages and heart rate variability). The aim of this project is to develop non-linear methods to analyze the complex dynamics of physiological signal.

-   Characterizing and clustering of scaling dynamics in physiological signals 
-   Analyzing nonlinear dynamics of physiological processes underlying signals through Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) modeling
